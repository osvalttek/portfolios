#Instructions to work with Astro.

We will need to run the following commands once the repository has been cloned.

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
| Command                | Action                                             |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`          | Installs dependencies                              |
| `npm run dev`          | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`        |
